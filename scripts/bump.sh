# Five values move: the version, and the sha256 of each of the three artifacts
# a Navigator release makes available (the macOS archive, the Linux archive,
# and the source tarball, which two platforms compile). The source tarball's
# digest appears twice, once per source-building platform. A sixth may move —
# `version_scheme` — for the reason below.
#
# BOTH RELEASE SHAPES ARE ACCEPTED: an ordinary `YY.M.D` and a same-day
# `YY.M.D-hotfix.N`. Navigator publishes archives for both, and this formula
# holds exactly one version, so the version it holds must be the newest build
# that exists rather than the newest of a particular shape. Refusing hotfixes is
# what left `brew install` serving a 404 for days while three ordinary releases
# in a row failed their end-to-end gate.
#
# WHICH IS WHY `version_scheme` MOVES. Homebrew's comparator is not semver: it
# orders `26.8.20-hotfix.4` ABOVE `26.8.20`, the reverse of the semver §11.3
# ranking Navigator's release tags are built on. So walking this formula from a
# hotfix to its own base version looks to `brew` like a DOWNGRADE — it reports
# the installed keg as current and never upgrades it. `version_scheme` is the
# mechanism Homebrew provides for exactly this (a higher scheme is newer than
# any lower-scheme keg regardless of version), and this script increments it
# whenever the new tag does not sort strictly above the outgoing one. Every bump
# is therefore an upgrade, whatever the shape of either tag.
#
# THE DIGESTS ARE COMPUTED FROM THE BYTES, NEVER COPIED FROM A RELEASE PAGE.
# A sha256 in a formula is the only thing standing between a reader and a
# substituted binary, so it is derived here by downloading the artifact this
# formula will tell every user to download.
#
# The formula's STRUCTURE is hand-maintained and this script must not invent
# it: it patches anchored lines in place and then asserts the result, so a
# structural edit that breaks the patch fails loudly instead of committing a
# formula with a stale digest.
