# The Neon Law Navigator CLI.
#
# THIS FILE IS REWRITTEN BY `scripts/bump.sh` ON EVERY RELEASE. Five values move
# — the version and four sha256 digests — and the script patches exactly those
# lines by anchored regex, then asserts the result. Structure is yours to edit
# by hand; the numbers are not.
#
# A sixth line, `version_scheme`, appears only once it is needed and is likewise
# the script's. Navigator publishes ordinary `YY.M.D` releases and same-day
# `YY.M.D-hotfix.N` prereleases, and this formula follows whichever is newest,
# because it holds ONE version and every `brew install` resolves to it. But
# Homebrew's comparator is not semver — it ranks `26.8.27` ABOVE
# `26.8.20` — so a bump from a hotfix to its own base version would read as a
# downgrade and `brew upgrade` would refuse to move. `bump.sh` detects that with
# Homebrew's own comparator and increments `version_scheme`, which outranks any
# lower-scheme keg regardless of version. See `scripts/bump.sh`.
#
# Two acquisition paths, because the release publishes two prebuilt
# architectures and no more:
#
#   - arm64 macOS and x86_64 Linux download the archive `deploy.yml` attached to
#     the GitHub Release. Seconds, no toolchain.
#   - Intel macOS and arm64 Linux compile the immutable source tag. Minutes, and
#     a Rust toolchain — but it is the only honest option for a platform whose
#     bytes were never built.
#
# Homebrew is also what makes the macOS binary usable at all. It is unsigned and
# unnotarized, and Gatekeeper blocks a *browser*-downloaded unsigned Mach-O
# outright; brew fetches with curl, which sets no `com.apple.quarantine`
# attribute, so the same bytes run. Signing is still worth doing — this is a
# workaround for its absence, not a replacement.
